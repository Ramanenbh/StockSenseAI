This is a project that I am building on my own for my own exploration of Generative AI and to build a stock information
aggregator that I can use for my own trading use. 
The app is hosted on streamlit UI, where given a stock ticker it can pull relevant latest information & actionables. I am also exploring using RAG to consider trends over time but to be implemented later. I shall slowly update the current features implemented.

Tasks Completed thus far:
1. Internet Search Tool
2. News Handling
3. Streamlit Frontend UI & Progress Logging
4. Routing if user keys invalid query

Tasks to do:
1. Flow after invalid query throws an error and needs to be fixed
