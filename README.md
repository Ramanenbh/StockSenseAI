This is a project that I am building on my own for my own exploration of Generative AI and to build a stock information
aggregator that I can use for my own trading use. 
The app is eventually meant to be hosted with a streamlit UI, where given a stock ticker it can pull relevant latest information & actionables. I am also exploring using RAG to consider trends over time but to be implemented later. I shall slowly update the current
features implemented.
NOTE: for now the code only focuses on semi-conductor stocks since it will be easier to narrow down the scope as a start

Tasks Completed thus far:
1. Internet Search Tool
2. News Handling

Tasks to do:
1. Appropriate Input Handling & Routing back to the user
2. Building the rating agency guidance trend node
